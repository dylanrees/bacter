bacter, written by dylan rees

bacter is a program for visualizing IV curve data for electromicrobiology.

DATA FORMAT FOR IV CURVES
* the first line should be "iv"
* newline separation between data points,
* tab separation between x/y or current/voltage.
* the first lines should be measurement coordinates,
* the rest will be IV data

DATA FORMAT FOR HEIGHT CURVES
* the first line should be "ht"
* rest will probably be the same as iv curves

bacter is written for python 3 and may not display
properly in python 2.
